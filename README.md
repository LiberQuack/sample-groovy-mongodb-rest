# sample-groovy-mongodb-rest
Simple example of todoApp using [Spark] (http://sparkjava.com), [MongoDB] (http://www.mongodb.org/), [Groovy] (http://groovy-lang.org) and [Java8] (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/java8-2100321.html)

I started to work with Mongo for the first time with nodejs, it was a great experience, but I am not a nodejs programming (I really like javascript... Really! for browsers) I`m a groovy programmer so I decided to join the best of two worlds using NoSQL (Not-Only SQL) with my favorite programming language
