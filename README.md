# sample-groovy-mongodb-rest
Simple example of todoApp using [Spark] (http://sparkjava.com), [MongoDB] (http://www.mongodb.org), [Groovy] (http://groovy-lang.org), [Jongo] (http://jongo.org) and [Java8] (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/java8-2100321.html)

I started to work with Mongo for the first time with nodejs, it was a great experience, but I am not a nodejs programming (I really like javascript... Really!!!) I`m better when programming in groovy so I decided to join the best of two worlds using NoSQL (Not-Only SQL) with my favorite programming language

## This project needs to:
- Be easy to change
- Be fast
- Be readable
- Be scalable
- Have DAOs really reusable, not like SQL (`String select = "SELECT * FROM TABLE WHERE X = ?"`)

## Running on Cloud 9
- Todo...
